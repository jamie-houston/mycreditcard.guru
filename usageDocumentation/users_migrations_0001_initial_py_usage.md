# 0001_initial.py Usage Documentation

## Executive Summary
This document provides usage documentation for the `users/migrations/0001_initial.py` module, which contains the initial Django database migration for the users application. This migration creates all the initial database tables, indexes, and constraints for user-related models including user profiles, preferences, and extended user data for the credit card recommendation system.

## Module Overview
`users/migrations/0001_initial.py` is an auto-generated Django migration file that defines the initial database schema for the users application. It creates all the necessary database tables, relationships, and constraints for user profile and preference management.

### Key Responsibilities:
- **Initial User Schema Creation**: Creates all database tables for UserProfile, UserPreferences, and other user-related models with proper field definitions
- **User Relationship Setup**: Establishes foreign key relationships with Django's User model and creates indexes for efficient user data queries
- **Migration Framework Integration**: Provides reversible database operations that Django's migration system can apply or rollback for user schema management


## Initialization
The `users/migrations/0001_initial.py` file is automatically executed by Django's migration framework. No manual initialization is required.

```python
# Automatic execution during Django migration
python manage.py migrate users

# Django automatically applies this migration to create initial user schema
# No explicit initialization code needed
```

## Public API documentation

### Migration Operations Interface
Provides Django migration operations for initial user database schema creation.

#### Core Operations:
- **CreateModel**: Defines database tables for UserProfile, UserPreferences, etc.
- **AddField**: Adds individual fields to user models
- **AddIndex**: Creates database indexes for user data performance
- **Dependencies**: Manages migration order and auth model relationships

## Dependencies
Minimal dependencies - standard framework dependencies.

## Practical Code Examples

### Example 1: Initial User Migration Application
How Django applies the initial users migration to create user database schema.

```bash
# Apply the initial user migration
python manage.py migrate users 0001

# Check migration status
python manage.py showmigrations users

# Creates tables: users_userprofile, users_userpreferences, etc.
```

### Example 2: User Migration Dependencies
How the users migration depends on Django's auth system.

```bash
# Users migration depends on Django auth migrations
python manage.py migrate auth  # Must run first
python manage.py migrate users # Then user models

# Creates proper foreign key relationships to auth.User
```
