# __init__.py Usage Documentation

## Executive Summary
This document provides usage documentation for the `cards/management/commands/__init__.py` module, which is a standard Python package initialization file for the cards Django management commands directory. This module marks the commands directory as a Python package, allowing Django to discover and load specific management commands for the cards application.

## Module Overview
`cards/management/commands/__init__.py` is a standard Python package initialization file that enables the commands directory to be treated as a Python package. It follows Django's standard management commands package structure and is automatically processed by Django's management framework.

### Key Responsibilities:
- **Commands Package Initialization**: Marks the cards/management/commands directory as a Python package, enabling Django to discover individual command files
- **Django Command Discovery**: Allows Django's management framework to recognize and load specific management commands like import_cards, run_scenario, etc.
- **Command Import Foundation**: Provides the foundation for Django's management system to import and execute individual management commands for cards data operations


## Initialization
The `cards/management/commands/__init__.py` file is automatically processed by Django's management framework. No manual initialization is required.

```python
# Automatic initialization during Django command discovery
# No explicit initialization code needed
# Django processes this when scanning for individual command files
```

## Public API documentation

### Commands Package Interface
Standard Python package initialization - no public API methods.

#### Command Discovery:
- **Package Marker**: Enables Django to discover individual command files
- **Command Framework**: Integrates with Django's management command system
- **Cards Commands**: Supports specific commands like import_cards, run_scenario, etc.

## Dependencies
Minimal dependencies - relies only on Python's standard package system and Django's management framework.

### External Dependencies:
- **Python Standard Library**: Package initialization system
- **Django Management Framework**: Command discovery and loading system

### Internal Dependencies:
- **Django Settings**: Must be listed in `INSTALLED_APPS` for proper discovery
- **Django Management System**: Relies on Django's management command infrastructure

## Practical Code Examples

### Example 1: Individual Command Execution
How Django uses this package structure to execute specific card commands.

```bash
# Individual commands enabled by package structure
python manage.py import_cards --file=data/input/cards/chase.json
python manage.py run_scenario --scenario=portfolio_optimization
python manage.py import_credit_types --file=data/system/credit_types.json

# Django discovers these commands in cards.management.commands package
```

### Example 2: Command File Discovery
How Django's management framework discovers specific command implementations.

```python
# Django automatically discovers command files:
# cards/management/commands/import_cards.py
# cards/management/commands/run_scenario.py
# cards/management/commands/import_spending_credits.py
# cards/management/commands/import_credit_types.py

# Each file contains a Command class extending BaseCommand
# This works because cards/management/commands/__init__.py marks it as a package
```
