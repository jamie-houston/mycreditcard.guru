# admin.py Usage Documentation

## Executive Summary
This document provides usage documentation for the `users/admin.py` module, which contains Django admin configuration for the users application. This is a standard Django admin module placeholder that provides the foundation for implementing administrative interfaces for user models, profiles, preferences, and user-related data management.

## Module Overview
`users/admin.py` is a 4-line standard Django admin module placeholder that imports admin and provides a location for implementing comprehensive administrative functionality for the users application. It follows Django's standard admin patterns and is ready for admin configuration.

### Key Responsibilities:
- **Admin Infrastructure Setup**: Provides Django admin import and placeholder structure for implementing user model administration interfaces
- **User Model Administration**: Ready for implementing admin interfaces for UserProfile, UserPreferences, and other user-related models with proper displays and filters  
- **User Data Management**: Prepared for configuring admin functionality for user account management, profile editing, preferences configuration, and user data oversight

## Initialization
Django admin configurations are automatically registered when Django starts. No manual initialization required.

```python
# Automatically initialized by Django admin framework
# Access via Django admin interface at /admin/
# Ready for implementing UserProfile and UserPreferences admin
```

## Public API documentation

### Placeholder Structure
Standard Django admin module that provides the foundation for implementing user model administration interfaces.

- `django.contrib.admin`: Django admin framework

### Internal Dependencies:
- `users.models`: UserProfile, UserPreferences models (when admin is implemented)
- Ready for: Administrative user management functionality

## Practical Code Examples

### Example 1: Future Admin Implementation Pattern
How user admin would be implemented when needed.

```python
# Future implementation pattern:
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import UserProfile, UserPreferences

@admin.register(UserProfile)
class UserProfileAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ['user', 'preferred_issuer', 'max_annual_fee']
    search_fields = ['user__username', 'user__email']
    list_filter = ['preferred_issuer', 'preferred_reward_type']

@admin.register(UserPreferences)
class UserPreferencesAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ['user', 'theme', 'email_notifications']
    search_fields = ['user__username']
    list_filter = ['theme', 'email_notifications']
```

### Example 2: Admin Interface Usage (When Implemented)
How the admin interface would work for user management.

```python
# Navigate to /admin/ in browser
# Access users section for:

# User Profiles - Credit card preferences management
# User Preferences - UI and notification settings
# User account oversight and data management
# Integration with Django's built-in User admin
```
