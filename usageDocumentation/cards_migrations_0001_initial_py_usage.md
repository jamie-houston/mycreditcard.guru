# 0001_initial.py Usage Documentation

## Executive Summary
This document provides usage documentation for the `cards/migrations/0001_initial.py` module, which contains the initial Django database migration for the cards application. This migration creates all the initial database tables, indexes, and constraints for credit card models including issuers, cards, reward types, spending categories, and user spending profiles.

## Module Overview
`cards/migrations/0001_initial.py` is an auto-generated Django migration file that defines the initial database schema for the cards application. It creates all the necessary database tables, relationships, and constraints for the credit card recommendation system.

### Key Responsibilities:
- **Initial Database Schema Creation**: Creates all database tables for Issuer, CreditCard, RewardType, SpendingCategory, UserSpendingProfile, and related models
- **Relationship & Constraint Setup**: Establishes foreign key relationships, indexes, and database constraints between card-related models
- **Migration Framework Integration**: Provides reversible database operations that Django's migration system can apply or rollback for schema management


## Initialization
The `cards/migrations/0001_initial.py` file is automatically executed by Django's migration framework. No manual initialization is required.

```python
# Automatic execution during Django migration
python manage.py migrate cards

# Django automatically applies this migration to create initial schema
# No explicit initialization code needed
```

## Public API documentation

### Migration Operations Interface
Provides Django migration operations for initial database schema creation.

#### Core Operations:
- **CreateModel**: Defines database tables for CreditCard, Issuer, RewardType, etc.
- **AddField**: Adds individual fields to models
- **AddIndex**: Creates database indexes for performance
- **Dependencies**: Manages migration order and relationships

## Dependencies
Minimal dependencies - standard framework dependencies.

## Practical Code Examples

### Example 1: Initial Migration Application
How Django applies the initial cards migration to create database schema.

```bash
# Apply the initial migration
python manage.py migrate cards 0001

# Check migration status
python manage.py showmigrations cards

# Creates tables: cards_creditcard, cards_issuer, cards_rewardtype, etc.
```

### Example 2: Migration Rollback
How to rollback the initial migration if needed (removes all cards tables).

```bash
# Rollback to before initial migration (removes all tables)
python manage.py migrate cards zero

# Re-apply initial migration
python manage.py migrate cards 0001

# This recreates the entire cards database schema
```
