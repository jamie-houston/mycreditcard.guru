# tests.py Usage Documentation

## Executive Summary
This document provides usage documentation for the `roadmaps/tests.py` module, which contains Django test classes for the roadmaps application. This is a standard Django test module placeholder that provides the foundation for implementing unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests for roadmap models, recommendation generation, and roadmap management functionality.

## Module Overview
`roadmaps/tests.py` is a 4-line standard Django test module placeholder that imports TestCase and provides a location for implementing comprehensive test coverage for the roadmaps application. It follows Django's standard testing patterns and is ready for test implementation.

### Key Responsibilities:
- **Test Infrastructure Setup**: Provides Django TestCase import and placeholder structure for implementing roadmap model and recommendation engine tests
- **Roadmap Functionality Testing**: Ready for implementing tests for roadmap creation, filter management, recommendation generation, and calculation accuracy
- **Recommendation Engine Testing**: Prepared for testing the complex recommendation algorithms, portfolio optimization, issuer policies, and recommendation validation with comprehensive test coverage

## Initialization
Django test classes are automatically discovered and run by Django's test runner. No manual initialization required.

```python
# Run tests via Django management command:
# python manage.py test roadmaps
# python manage.py test roadmaps.tests.TestRecommendationEngine
```

## Public API documentation

### Django Test Infrastructure
Standard Django test module that provides the foundation for implementing comprehensive test coverage for roadmap functionality.

#### Test Discovery:
Django automatically discovers and runs tests in this module when using `python manage.py test`

#### Available Test Base Classes:
- **`TestCase`**: Django's enhanced TestCase with database transaction support
- **`TransactionTestCase`**: For tests requiring database transaction testing
- **`SimpleTestCase`**: For tests that don't require database access
- **`LiveServerTestCase`**: For full integration testing with live server

### Testing Patterns (When Implemented)
- Model tests for Roadmap, RoadmapFilter, RoadmapRecommendation validation
- View tests for roadmap API endpoints and recommendation generation
- Serializer tests for roadmap data validation and transformation
- Integration tests for the recommendation engine algorithms and calculations

## Dependencies
### External Dependencies:
- `django.test.TestCase`: Django testing framework

### Internal Dependencies:
- `roadmaps.models`: Models to be tested (when tests are implemented)
- `roadmaps.views`: Views to be tested (when tests are implemented)
- `roadmaps.recommendation_engine`: Core recommendation logic to be tested
- `roadmaps.serializers`: Serializers to be tested (when tests are implemented)

## Practical Code Examples

### Example 1: Future Test Implementation Pattern
How roadmap tests would be implemented when needed.

```python
# Future implementation pattern:
from django.test import TestCase
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from roadmaps.models import Roadmap, RoadmapFilter, RoadmapRecommendation
from roadmaps.recommendation_engine import RecommendationEngine
from decimal import Decimal

class TestRecommendationEngine(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.user = User.objects.create_user(username="testuser")
        self.filter = RoadmapFilter.objects.create(
            max_annual_fee=Decimal("150.00"),
            preferred_issuer="Chase"
        )
    
    def test_roadmap_creation(self):
        roadmap = Roadmap.objects.create(
            name="Test Strategy",
            user=self.user,
            roadmap_filter=self.filter
        )
        self.assertEqual(roadmap.name, "Test Strategy")
        self.assertEqual(roadmap.user, self.user)

    def test_recommendation_generation(self):
        engine = RecommendationEngine()
        recommendations = engine.generate_quick_recommendations(
            spending_profile=[{"category": "Travel", "amount": "500.00"}],
            filters={"max_annual_fee": "150.00"}
        )
        self.assertIsInstance(recommendations, list)
        self.assertGreater(len(recommendations), 0)

class TestRoadmapAPI(TestCase):
    def test_roadmap_list_endpoint(self):
        self.client.force_login(self.user)
        response = self.client.get('/api/roadmaps/')
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
```

### Example 2: Running Tests
How to run roadmap tests when implemented.

```python
# Run all roadmaps app tests
# python manage.py test roadmaps

# Run specific test class
# python manage.py test roadmaps.tests.TestRecommendationEngine

# Run specific test method
# python manage.py test roadmaps.tests.TestRecommendationEngine.test_recommendation_generation

# Run with verbose output for algorithm testing
# python manage.py test roadmaps --verbosity=2

# Run with coverage for recommendation engine
# coverage run --source='.' manage.py test roadmaps
# coverage report --include="roadmaps/*"
```
