# serializers.py Usage Documentation

## Executive Summary
This document provides usage documentation for the `roadmaps/serializers.py` module, which contains Django REST Framework serializers for roadmap data transformation and validation. These serializers handle roadmap filters, roadmaps with nested relationships, recommendations, calculations, and complex roadmap generation logic with comprehensive validation and temporary data handling.

## Module Overview
`roadmaps/serializers.py` is a 236-line Django REST Framework serializers module that provides data transformation layers for roadmap-related models. It includes serializers for roadmap management, recommendation generation, and complex logic for handling temporary user profiles and recommendation generation.

### Key Responsibilities:
- **Roadmap Data Serialization**: Handles RoadmapFilterSerializer, RoadmapSerializer with nested relationships, and RoadmapRecommendationSerializer for converting roadmap models to JSON with proper field selection
- **Roadmap Creation & Management**: Implements CreateRoadmapSerializer for creating roadmaps with filters and user/session handling for both authenticated and anonymous users
- **Complex Recommendation Generation**: Provides GenerateRoadmapSerializer with intricate logic for updating spending amounts, user cards, spending credit preferences, and calling RecommendationEngine with temporary data handling


## Initialization
The `roadmaps/serializers.py` module is automatically loaded by Django when the roadmaps app is imported. Serializers are instantiated by Django REST Framework views.

```python
# Automatic loading when roadmaps app is imported
from roadmaps.serializers import RoadmapSerializer, RecommendationSerializer

# Instantiated by DRF views automatically
# No manual initialization required
```

## Public API documentation

### Serializer Classes
Provides Django REST Framework serializers for roadmap data transformation.

#### Core Serializers:
- **RoadmapSerializer**: Serializes roadmap models for API responses
- **RecommendationSerializer**: Handles recommendation data serialization
- **RoadmapFilterSerializer**: Manages filter criteria serialization
- **Data Validation**: Provides input validation for roadmap operations

## Dependencies
Minimal dependencies - standard framework dependencies.

## Practical Code Examples

### Example 1: Roadmap API Serialization
How roadmap serializers transform model data for API responses.

```python
# In roadmaps/views.py - API endpoint usage
from roadmaps.serializers import RoadmapSerializer, RecommendationSerializer
from roadmaps.models import Roadmap

class RoadmapViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Roadmap.objects.all()
    serializer_class = RoadmapSerializer

# Automatically serializes roadmap data for JSON API responses
```

### Example 2: Recommendation Data Processing
How recommendation serializers handle complex recommendation data.

```python
# In roadmaps/views.py - recommendation endpoint
from roadmaps.serializers import RecommendationSerializer
from roadmaps.recommendation_engine import RecommendationEngine

def generate_recommendations(request):
    engine = RecommendationEngine()
    recommendations = engine.get_recommendations(request.user)
    
    serializer = RecommendationSerializer(recommendations, many=True)
    return Response(serializer.data)
```
