# tests.py Usage Documentation

## Executive Summary
This document provides usage documentation for the `cards/tests.py` module, which contains Django test classes for the cards application. This is a standard Django test module placeholder that provides the foundation for implementing unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests for credit card models, API endpoints, and recommendation functionality.

## Module Overview
`cards/tests.py` is a 4-line standard Django test module placeholder that imports TestCase and provides a location for implementing comprehensive test coverage for the cards application. It follows Django's standard testing patterns and is ready for test implementation.

### Key Responsibilities:
- **Test Infrastructure Setup**: Provides Django TestCase import and placeholder structure for implementing credit card model and API tests
- **Cards Functionality Testing**: Ready for implementing tests for credit card CRUD operations, reward calculations, user spending profiles, and recommendation features
- **API Endpoint Testing**: Prepared for testing card-related API endpoints, serializers, views, search functionality, and recommendation algorithms with comprehensive test coverage

## Initialization
Django test classes are automatically discovered and run by Django's test runner. No manual initialization required.

```python
# Run tests via Django management command:
# python manage.py test cards
# python manage.py test cards.tests.TestCreditCardModel
```

## Public API documentation

### Django Test Infrastructure
Standard Django test module that provides the foundation for implementing comprehensive test coverage.

#### Test Discovery:
Django automatically discovers and runs tests in this module when using `python manage.py test`

#### Available Test Base Classes:
- **`TestCase`**: Django's enhanced TestCase with database transaction support
- **`TransactionTestCase`**: For tests requiring database transaction testing
- **`SimpleTestCase`**: For tests that don't require database access
- **`LiveServerTestCase`**: For full integration testing with live server

### Testing Patterns (When Implemented)
- Model tests for CreditCard, Issuer, RewardType validation
- View tests for API endpoints and authentication
- Serializer tests for data validation and transformation
- Integration tests for recommendation algorithms

## Dependencies
### External Dependencies:
- `django.test.TestCase`: Django testing framework

### Internal Dependencies:
- `cards.models`: Models to be tested (when tests are implemented)
- `cards.views`: Views to be tested (when tests are implemented)
- `cards.serializers`: Serializers to be tested (when tests are implemented)

## Practical Code Examples

### Example 1: Future Test Implementation Pattern
How card tests would be implemented when needed.

```python
# Future implementation pattern:
from django.test import TestCase
from cards.models import CreditCard, Issuer, RewardType
from decimal import Decimal

class TestCreditCardModel(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.issuer = Issuer.objects.create(name="Chase")
        self.reward_type = RewardType.objects.create(name="Travel Points")
    
    def test_credit_card_creation(self):
        card = CreditCard.objects.create(
            name="Chase Sapphire Preferred",
            issuer=self.issuer,
            annual_fee=Decimal("95.00"),
            primary_reward_type=self.reward_type
        )
        self.assertEqual(card.name, "Chase Sapphire Preferred")
        self.assertEqual(card.annual_fee, Decimal("95.00"))

class TestCreditCardAPI(TestCase):
    def test_card_list_endpoint(self):
        response = self.client.get('/api/cards/')
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
```

### Example 2: Running Tests
How to run card tests when implemented.

```python
# Run all cards app tests
# python manage.py test cards

# Run specific test class
# python manage.py test cards.tests.TestCreditCardModel

# Run specific test method
# python manage.py test cards.tests.TestCreditCardModel.test_credit_card_creation

# Run with verbose output
# python manage.py test cards --verbosity=2

# Run with coverage reporting
# coverage run --source='.' manage.py test cards
# coverage report
```
