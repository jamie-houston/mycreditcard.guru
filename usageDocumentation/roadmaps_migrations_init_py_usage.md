# __init__.py Usage Documentation

## Executive Summary
This document provides usage documentation for the `roadmaps/migrations/__init__.py` module, which is a standard Python package initialization file for the roadmaps Django migrations directory. This module marks the migrations directory as a Python package, allowing Django's migration framework to discover and load database migration files for the roadmaps application.

## Module Overview
`roadmaps/migrations/__init__.py` is a standard Python package initialization file that enables the migrations directory to be treated as a Python package. It follows Django's standard migration package structure and is automatically processed by Django's migration framework.

### Key Responsibilities:
- **Migration Package Initialization**: Marks the roadmaps/migrations directory as a Python package, enabling Django to discover migration files
- **Django Migration Discovery**: Allows Django's migration framework to recognize and load database migration files for the roadmaps application
- **Migration Import Foundation**: Provides the foundation for Django's migration system to import and execute database schema changes for the roadmaps models


## Initialization
The `roadmaps/migrations/__init__.py` file is automatically processed by Django's migration framework. No manual initialization is required.

```python
# Automatic initialization during Django migration discovery
# No explicit initialization code needed
# Django processes this when scanning for migration files
```

## Public API documentation

### Migration Package Interface
Standard Python package initialization - no public API methods.

#### Migration Discovery:
- **Package Marker**: Enables Django to discover migration files in the directory
- **Migration Framework**: Integrates with Django's migration system
- **Roadmap Schema Management**: Supports database schema version control for roadmap models

## Dependencies
Minimal dependencies - standard framework dependencies.

## Practical Code Examples

### Example 1: Django Migration Commands
How Django uses this package structure to discover and run roadmap migrations.

```bash
# Django migration commands enabled by package structure
python manage.py makemigrations roadmaps
python manage.py migrate roadmaps
python manage.py showmigrations roadmaps

# Django discovers migrations in roadmaps.migrations package
```

### Example 2: Roadmap Model Migration Discovery
How Django's migration framework discovers roadmap-related migration files.

```python
# Django automatically scans roadmaps/migrations/ for files like:
# 0001_initial.py - Initial roadmap and recommendation models
# 0002_add_filters.py - Roadmap filter functionality
# 0003_extend_calculations.py - Extended calculation fields

# This works because roadmaps/migrations/__init__.py marks it as a package
```
