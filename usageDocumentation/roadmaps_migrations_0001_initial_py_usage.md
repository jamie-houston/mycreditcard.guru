# 0001_initial.py Usage Documentation

## Executive Summary
This document provides usage documentation for the `roadmaps/migrations/0001_initial.py` module, which contains the initial Django database migration for the roadmaps application. This migration creates all the initial database tables, indexes, and constraints for roadmap-related models including roadmap filters, roadmaps, recommendations, and calculation data for the credit card recommendation system.

## Module Overview
`roadmaps/migrations/0001_initial.py` is an auto-generated Django migration file that defines the initial database schema for the roadmaps application. It creates all the necessary database tables, relationships, and constraints for roadmap management and recommendation storage.

### Key Responsibilities:
- **Initial Roadmap Schema Creation**: Creates all database tables for RoadmapFilter, Roadmap, RoadmapRecommendation, RoadmapCalculation, and related models
- **Recommendation Relationship Setup**: Establishes foreign key relationships between roadmaps, users, and credit cards with proper indexing for recommendation queries
- **Migration Framework Integration**: Provides reversible database operations that Django's migration system can apply or rollback for roadmap schema management


## Initialization
The `roadmaps/migrations/0001_initial.py` file is automatically executed by Django's migration framework. No manual initialization is required.

```python
# Automatic execution during Django migration
python manage.py migrate roadmaps

# Django automatically applies this migration to create initial roadmap schema
# No explicit initialization code needed
```

## Public API documentation

### Migration Operations Interface
Provides Django migration operations for initial roadmap database schema creation.

#### Core Operations:
- **CreateModel**: Defines database tables for Roadmap, RoadmapFilter, RoadmapRecommendation, etc.
- **AddField**: Adds individual fields to roadmap models
- **AddIndex**: Creates database indexes for recommendation performance
- **Dependencies**: Manages migration order and user/card model relationships

## Dependencies
Minimal dependencies - standard framework dependencies.

## Practical Code Examples

### Example 1: Initial Roadmap Migration Application
How Django applies the initial roadmaps migration to create recommendation database schema.

```bash
# Apply the initial roadmap migration
python manage.py migrate roadmaps 0001

# Check migration status
python manage.py showmigrations roadmaps

# Creates tables: roadmaps_roadmap, roadmaps_recommendation, etc.
```

### Example 2: Roadmap Migration Dependencies
How the roadmaps migration depends on cards and users systems.

```bash
# Roadmaps migration depends on cards and users migrations
python manage.py migrate cards  # Must run first
python manage.py migrate users  # Must run first
python manage.py migrate roadmaps # Then roadmap models

# Creates proper foreign key relationships to cards and users
```
