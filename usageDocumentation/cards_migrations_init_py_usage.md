# __init__.py Usage Documentation

## Executive Summary
This document provides usage documentation for the `cards/migrations/__init__.py` module, which is a standard Python package initialization file for the cards Django migrations directory. This module marks the migrations directory as a Python package, allowing Django's migration framework to discover and load database migration files for the cards application.

## Module Overview
`cards/migrations/__init__.py` is a standard Python package initialization file that enables the migrations directory to be treated as a Python package. It follows Django's standard migration package structure and is automatically processed by Django's migration framework.

### Key Responsibilities:
- **Migration Package Initialization**: Marks the cards/migrations directory as a Python package, enabling Django to discover migration files
- **Django Migration Discovery**: Allows Django's migration framework to recognize and load database migration files for the cards application
- **Migration Import Foundation**: Provides the foundation for Django's migration system to import and execute database schema changes for the cards models


## Initialization
The `cards/migrations/__init__.py` file is automatically processed by Django's migration framework. No manual initialization is required.

```python
# Automatic initialization during Django migration discovery
# No explicit initialization code needed
# Django processes this when scanning for migration files
```

## Public API documentation

### Migration Package Interface
Standard Python package initialization - no public API methods.

#### Migration Discovery:
- **Package Marker**: Enables Django to discover migration files in the directory
- **Migration Framework**: Integrates with Django's migration system
- **Schema Management**: Supports database schema version control

## Dependencies
Minimal dependencies - relies only on Python's standard package system and Django's migration framework.

### External Dependencies:
- **Python Standard Library**: Package initialization system
- **Django Migration Framework**: Migration discovery and loading system

### Internal Dependencies:
- **Django Settings**: Must be listed in `INSTALLED_APPS` for proper discovery
- **Django Migration System**: Relies on Django's migration infrastructure

## Practical Code Examples

### Example 1: Django Migration Commands
How Django uses this package structure to discover and run migrations.

```bash
# Django migration commands enabled by package structure
python manage.py makemigrations cards
python manage.py migrate cards
python manage.py showmigrations cards

# Django discovers migrations in cards.migrations package
```

### Example 2: Migration File Discovery
How Django's migration framework discovers individual migration files.

```python
# Django automatically scans cards/migrations/ for files like:
# 0001_initial.py
# 0002_add_reward_multiplier.py
# 0003_update_issuer_fields.py

# This works because cards/migrations/__init__.py marks it as a package
```
