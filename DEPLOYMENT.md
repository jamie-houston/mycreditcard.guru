```

## üèóÔ∏è Production Deployment

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:
```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-production-secret-key
DEBUG=False
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/creditcard_guru
ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com,www.yourdomain.com
```

### Database Setup

For production, use PostgreSQL:

```bash
# Install PostgreSQL
pip install psycopg2-binary

# Update settings.py for production database
# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Import your credit card data
python manage.py import_cards your_production_cards.json
```

### Static Files

```bash
# Collect static files for production
python manage.py collectstatic
```

### Recommended Production Stack

- **Web Server**: Nginx
- **WSGI Server**: Gunicorn
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Task Queue**: Celery (for background recommendation calculations)
- **Platform**: DigitalOcean, AWS, or Heroku

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Credit Cards

1. **Via Admin Interface**: Add cards manually through Django admin
2. **Via JSON Import**: Create JSON file and use import command
3. **Via API**: Use the REST API to add cards programmatically

### Extending the Recommendation Engine

The recommendation engine is in `roadmaps/recommendation_engine.py`. You can:

- Add new issuer-specific rules
- Implement more sophisticated reward calculations
- Add temporal factors (card application timing)
- Include credit score considerations

### Frontend Customization

The HTML interface is in `templates/index.html`. You can:

- Modify the styling and layout
- Add new input fields
- Integrate with a frontend framework (React, Vue, etc.)
- Add data visualization for recommendations

## üîß Development

### Running Tests
